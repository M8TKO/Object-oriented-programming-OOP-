In this task, it is necessary to illustrate the use of overloaded operators in SFML in the manner described in the following text.

Three files are provided: the file *Lopta.h*, the file *Prozor.h*, and the file *main.cpp* (be sure to download all three files from the provided links).
The files contain implementations of the *Lopta* class and the *Prozor* class, which you will need to extend.
As their names suggest, the *Prozor* class represents a window with dimensions 800 x 600 and the title "Loptanje" (Ball Game), 
while the *Lopta* class represents a circle that moves within the window and bounces off its edges. 
Observe what is currently stored in each of these classes and which methods they currently have
(you are free to add methods to the classes and store whatever is needed about these classes â€“ if you change existing methods,
be sure to mention it in the text field when submitting the solution!).
